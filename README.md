# Moon Noise

Moon Noise is a procedural noise generator using a reverse-engineered music visualiser to create audio noise.

It uses a photograph of the Moon's topology.

**Disclaimer**

It sounds quite bad, this is partly due to how the Moon looks weird. Also due to the buggy pygame music player.

Also due to my terrible coding.

have fun! :)
